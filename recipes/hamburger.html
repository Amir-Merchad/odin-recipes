    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A hamburger, also known as a burger, is a popular sandwich consisting of a ground meat patty,
      typically beef, that is grilled, fried, or flame-broiled and served between a sliced bun.
      It is often accompanied by various toppings and condiments, such as lettuce, tomato, onion,
      pickles, cheese, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and special sauces. The patty is usually
      seasoned with a pinch of salt and pepper, and the bun is often topped with sesame seeds.
      According to USDA standards, hamburger meat must be ground from fresh beef with no by-products
      or nonmeat extenders, but loose beef fat and seasonings are permitted. The ideal fat content
      for a hamburger patty is around 15%, which is considered optimal for juiciness and flavor.

    <p>A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.
      The term "hamburger" originally derives from Hamburg, the second-largest city
      in Germany, but there is no specific connection between the dish and the city.
      The term "burger" has become a self-standing word associated with many different
      types of sandwiches that are similar to a hamburger but contain different meats such
      as buffalo, venison, kangaroo, chicken, turkey, elk, lamb, or fish such as salmon, and
      even meatless sandwiches as is the case with the veggie burger.
